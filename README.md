# Explanation of Brand
## Toyota has a great brand personality called Balanced spirit which means a perfect mix of style and technology with a fun way to drive. The colors are white and red which is the main color theme i have used in my landing page.

# Brand Guidelines
- Red and white colors
- keep perspectives with customers
- work with integrity
- accurate pricing

# Customer Persona
## I created customer persona to apply details of customer and also car pricing:
- Name
- age
- gender
- profession
- car pricing 
- finance and insurance

# Application to the app
- It supports mobile-first approach and also fits perfectly on the entire site to be user freindly. This is used in the site as the image adjusts to the size of page and features are moved around so they are clear to see
- simple navbar to see where you want to go as shown in the site and simple layout that looks appealing to user.

# Design principles used
-Philosophy
-Process
-people/partners
-problem solving

# Things i struggled with
## I struggled with adding text into images as it would make the image smaller and move into different parts of the page which unfortunately i could not figure out.
